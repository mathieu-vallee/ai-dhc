Data set for solar thermal unbalance

UnbalancedRegular : 
* experiments with regular fault intensity (from 0 to 1 with step 0.05)
* 21 experiment for each of the 4 rows, so 84 experiments in total

UnbalancedRandom
* experiments with random fault intensity
* 21 experiment for each of the 4 rows, so 84 experiments in total
* also adding reference cases (no fault) from UnbalancedRegular (R*-unbr-000)

  "description": "This dataset contains data generated in the AI DHC project.\n\n***This dataset contains synthetic fault data for degradation of the insulation of a water storage tank***\n\nThe IEA DHC Annex XIII project \u201cArtificial Intelligence for Failure Detection and Forecasting of Heat Production and Heat demand in District Heating Networks\u201d is developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods for forecasting heat demand and heat production and is evaluating algorithms for detecting faults which can be used by interested stakeholders (operators, suppliers of DHC components and manufacturers of control devices).\n\nSee https://github.com/mathieu-vallee/ai-dhc for the models and pythons scripts used to generate the dataset\n\nPlease cite this dataset as:\nVallee, M., Wissocq T., Gaoua Y., Lamaison N., Generation and Evaluation of a Synthetic Dataset to improve Fault Detection in District Heating and Cooling Systems, 2023 (under review at the Energy journal)\n\n**Disclaimer notice (IEA DHC):**\nThis project has been independently funded by the International Energy Agency Technology Collaboration Programme on District Heating and Cooling including Combined Heat and Power (IEA DHC).\n\nAny views expressed in this publication are not necessarily those of IEA DHC. \n\nIEA DHC can take no responsibility for the use of the information within this publication, nor for any errors or omissions it may contain.\n\nInformation contained herein have been compiled or arrived from sources believed to be reliable.
